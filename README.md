# Self.Tube

**Self.Tube** will be a sleek, lightweight client for [TubeArchivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist), designed to bring your personal YouTube archive right to your Android or Linux phone.

With a streamlined interface and direct connection to your TubeArchivist server, Self.Tube will make it easy to browse, search, and stream your archived content from anywhere.


## Info

⚠️ This is an early-stage, experimental project. It works, but the code is messy and evolving. I'm not a professional developer — just someone learning Flutter. Contributions and constructive feedback are welcome!

## Why Self.Tube

TubeArchivist is amazing for archiving, but it’s built for use in a Web-Browser. Self.Tube fills the gap by giving you a native app experience tailored for mobile devices. It’s open-source, privacy-respecting, and built for power users who want full control of their media.
## Building

You can build and run Self.Tube using the provided Nix Flake setup. This ensures a reproducible development environment with all dependencies preconfigured.

### Prerequisites
- Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download)
- Enable experimental features for flakes and the `nix develop` command

### Steps

```bash
1. Install Nix (if not already installed)
    → https://nixos.org/download

2. Clone the repository
   git clone https://codeberg.org/wreckingbang/self.tube
   cd self.tube

3. Enter the development shell using flakes
   nix develop --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'

4. Run the app with Flutter
   flutter run
```
